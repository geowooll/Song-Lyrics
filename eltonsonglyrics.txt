You could never know what it's likeYour blood like winter freezes just like iceAnd there's a cold lonely light that shines from youYou'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you useAnd did you think this fool could never win?Well look at me, I'm coming back againI got a taste of love in a simple wayAnd if you need to know while I'm still standing, you just fade awayDon't you know I'm still standing better than I ever didLooking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kidI'm still standing after all this timePicking up the pieces of my life without you on my mindI'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)I'm still standing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
